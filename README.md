# Interactive-Auto-Thefts
An app for an interactive visualizer for Toronto auto thefts using R and the packages Shiny and Leaflet. Users have the option to filter Toronto auto thefts by month, year, and neighborhood to view density of thefts on a map. Information is also displayed in a bar graph showing the number of theft occurences per year, and changes based on which neighborhoods have been selected. 

The inspiration for this project came from a statistics course (view repository STA130), where we worked with this data to try to optimize when and where police could station their cars to minimze auto thefts. 

Data was pulled from the Toronto police site.
